Results with existing samples are better than reported in paper.
 * Somewhere between 1-7%
 * Program seems deterministic, so unlikely due to RNG
 * Does vary slightly (~1-2%) by computer.  Maybe be attributable to floating point error or library compilations.
 * Possible newer versions of libraries are optimized to perform better
In the paper some of the numbers don't quite add up
 * The confusion matrix has columns with sum to greater than 1.
 * Possibly just types/copypasta
